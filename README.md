# Scontrino

Scontrino is a family of fonts that mimics a receipt. I plan to use it on my website, so in the beginning I'm going to focus more on the kind of glyphs I'll need.

I'm not a typographer, so I'm just going to scan receipts, vectorize glyphs, and compiling a font. I'm going to use FontForge, of which I have a Jon-Snow-level of understanding, so there'll be errors. If you happen to know a bit more about it, drop a issue and I'll fix it.

## The Family

My understanding is that there's a group of fonts that are widely used all over the world, and that have two style: regular and double (the height). These are the fonts on which I'm going to prioritize. There's also a wide version, as well as different families. I'll try to cover as much as I can.

These kind of fonts have a limited set of glyphs that I'd like to broad as much as I can without losing the feel of the original thermal-paper font. This means that when the font will be complete I'll add glyphs such as `@`, `ü`, etc. These glyphs are not common in my country's receipts, so I'll make them from scratch. I'll post a table to show which glyphs are original and which are made from scratch. If you happen to have original versions of glyphs I made up, open an issue.

### The variants

One of the main reasons I'm starting this project is that the font I currently use has a glyph for `’`. This makes some less convincing receipt when paired with markdown engines that change every `'` in `’`. Same goes for `"`. In the main version of the font I plan to use dumb quotes in place of smart ones, but when I'll be there I'll release a version with smart quotes. To each its own.
